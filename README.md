# codoff
codoff: simple program to infer possible horizontal gene transfer based on gene-cluster to genome-wide codon usage differences (mainly designed to work with antiSMASH BGC predictions)

codoff is largely adapted from the `compareBGCToGenomeWideCodonUsage.py` script in the lsaBGC suite and this is just to make it easy to install via bioconda, therefore, please cite:
